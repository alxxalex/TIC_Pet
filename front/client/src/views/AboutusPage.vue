      <h2 class="sub-heading">Why Choose Adoption?</h2>
      <p class="about-description">
        Adopting a pet is a rewarding experience. Not only are you giving a pet a second chance at life, but you're also making room for shelters to save more animals. By choosing adoption, you become part of a community that values love, kindness, and hope.
